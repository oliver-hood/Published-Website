    <h1>The Six Thinking Hats</h1>

  <div class='sixhats'>
    <h3>A Website Where Smokers Quit for Good.</h3>
    <p>My website will be the first website of its kind to help smokers gradually reduce their vaping use. By using a bluetooth enbaled smart device that track puffs, users will be able to reduce their habits and eventually quit. Smoking cessation websites are not new, but most websites focus on cold turkey quitting, causing many users to fail in frustration. My website will also incorporate social features to add an element of support. </p>

      <div class="hats">
        <div class='white'>
          <h4>White Hat</h4>
          <h6>What information do we have? </h6>
          <p> We know that the website will connect to a smart vape to collect vaping data to then help the user quit.</p>
          <h6>What information do we need?</h6>
          <p> How will the data be displayed? How will the website help users use this data to make changes? </p>
          <h6>What is missing? </h6>
          <p> What will the website look like stylistically? How will social features be implemented? </p>
          <h6>What questions need to be asked? </h6>
          <p> Will this genuinely help users quit, or could it encourage them to smoke more? </p>
          <h6>How do we get this information?</h6>
          <p> We could run tests with actual vapers to see if they find my website encouraging or too addictive. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='red'>
          <h4>Red Hat</h4>
          <h6>What am I feeling about this? </h6>
          <p>It seems like a unique and novel concept, but it seems difficult to implement properly.</p>
          <h6>What intuition or hunches do you have? </h6>
          <p> For certain users, the smart vape tracking could encourage them to vape more. </p>
          <h6>What are your range of feelings about this? </h6>
          <p> It seems like it could do well, but it needs to be very specific about not encouraging users to vape more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='black' id="black">
          <h4>Black Hat</h4>
          <h6>What doesn’t fit? </h6>
          <p>Direct messages probably wouldn't be the best feature for a vaping cessation website.</p>
          <h6>What are the problems or faults? </h6>
          <p>Tracking vape usage might normalize or gamify the habit rather than discourage it.</p>
          <h6>What are the potential problems? </h6>
          <p>Users might treat the tracking as a way to “optimize” their vape usage rather than reduce it.</p>
          <h6>What are downsides? </h6>
          <p>Data privacy and security could be an issue, especially with sensitive health info.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='yellow'>
          <h4>Yellow Hat</h4>
          <h6>Why might this work? </h6>
          <p> It supports gradual behavior change rather than immediate quitting, which is more realistic for many users.</p>
          <h6>What value does this have? </h6>
          <p>It provides a non-judgmental and data based way to quit, something that other methods fail to do.</p>
          <h6>What could we do to make this work? </h6>
          <p>Use friendly visualizations, progress milestones, and daily achievements to keep users engaged.</p>
          <h6>What might make this more attractive to users? </h6>
          <p>Adding community support features like group challenges, milestones, or support forums could boost motivation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='green'>
          <h4>Green Hat</h4>
          <h6>What are other ways to look at this? </h6>
          <p>Rather than just a quitting tool, the site could be framed as a health and wellness platform.</p>
          <h6>What are alternatives haven’t we considered? </h6>
          <p>We could explore syncing with smartwatches (like the apple watch with oxygen tracking) for additional health tracking or breath-monitoring tools.</p>
          <h6>What ideas do you have about this? </h6>
          <p>Gamifying progress with badges or streaks could help people stay motivated without feeling punished.</p>
          <h6>How can we fix the Black Hat problems? </h6>
          <p>Frame the app around reduction goals and allow users to set their own limits rather than just track usage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='blue'>
          <h4>Blue Hat</h4>
          <h6>What is the subject? </h6>
          <p>Designing a website that helps users reduce and quit vaping through smart tracking and support. </p>
          <h6>What are we thinking about?</h6>
          <p>How to build a site that genuinely helps people change their habits without backfiring.</p>
          <h6>What is our goal? </h6>
          <p>To create a digital product that makes quitting feel attainable, personalized, and supported. (OR STRAIGHT UP ENDING VAPING!)</p>
          <h6>How do we keep our discussion on track? </h6>
          <p>It'd be importatant to evaluate each idea through the user’s lens. Do these features  help them quit, or does it create friction? </p>
          <h6>What conclusions do we have for each hat? </h6>
          <li>
            <ul>White - We need more design input and testing data from real users. </ul>
            <ul>Red - There’s excitement and concern; it must be designed with a bit of caution.</ul>
            <ul>Black - Potential to encourage more vaping if misused or poorly framed.</ul>
            <ul>Yellow - Strong value in offering a novel, data-supported quitting method. </ul>
            <ul>Green - Opportunity to reframe it as a lifestyle tool, not just a cessation site. </ul>
            <ul>Blue - Goal is to support quitting through thoughtful design, testing, and user empathy. </ul>
          </li>

      <h3> Key Findings </h3>
      <p>The success of this website depends on balancing data tracking with emotional support. While the idea of using a smart device to gradually reduce vaping is promising, it risks backfiring if it ecourages vaping instead of quitting. Users need clear, customizable goals and a design that feels encouraging rather than judgmental. Social features must be carefully implemented to build community without distraction. Overall, the concept is strong, but thoughtful design choices will determine whether the site empowers users to quit or unintentionally reinforces the habit.
